This directory contains test data files (*.feature.original) used by
Pickler's RSpec test suite (see "../spec").  Pickler is *not* tested
using Cucumber, and there are no Cucumbers for testing Pickler's
functionality in this directory.

During test execution, Pickler will read, write, and remove *.feature
files in this directory.  Do not create files in this directory with a
bare ".feature" extension if they are expected to be preserved across
test runs or maintained in Git.

In fact, Pickler's .gitignore prevents *.feature files in/below this
directory from being archived, so that transient test data will not be
caught in commit operations.
